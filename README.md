## Overview

This is my submission for the third Frontend Mentor project, built with vanilla HTML and CSS. I've really started to establish an efficient workflow, having more experience with each project I work on, which has allowed me to explore deeper into the possibilities of these languages. So for funzies I added smooth transition effect to the link buttons.

## My process

Started with my HTML structure, referencing the example to organize it in the best way. Then I started designing with CSS, starting from the lankmark elements and big details, working to the small details. I then used CSS media queries to make the necessary responsive display adjustments. Finally touching up some of the spacing and adding some smooth transition effects to the buttons.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex


### What I learned

Better understanding of "button" elements and their design properties, as well as getting use to working with responsive display styling. Additionally taking some extra time to play around with the styling effects such as transition, and the possibilities with using those.

### Continued development

While I generally prefer to deepen my expertise in a select few programs rather than spread myself too thin, I am eager to start working with libraries more in the future. I'm seeking web design tips that will enable me to minimize time spent on styling so I can focus more on functionality.
